# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

An open-source MDB (Multi-Drop Bus) cashless payment implementation for vending machines using ESP32-S3. The system has four main parts:

- **mdb-slave-esp32s3** – ESP32-S3 firmware acting as an MDB cashless device (peripheral)
- **mdb-master-esp32s3** – ESP32-S3 firmware simulating a VMC (vending machine controller) for testing
- **Docker** – Self-hosted backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + auth + edge functions), MQTT broker, Deno MQTT forwarder
- **management-frontend** – Nuxt 4 management dashboard (TypeScript, shadcn-nuxt, TailwindCSS 4, PWA, i18n)

---

## Firmware (ESP-IDF)

Both components use **ESP-IDF v5.x** with CMake and FreeRTOS.

```bash
. $IDF_PATH/export.sh   # activate ESP-IDF environment first

idf.py build
idf.py flash monitor
idf.py menuconfig       # hardware pins, features
```

### mdb-slave-esp32s3 Architecture

Single main file `main/mdb-slave-esp32s3.c` runs these concurrent FreeRTOS tasks:
- `mdb_cashless_loop` – MDB protocol handler on UART2 (GPIO4 RX, GPIO5 TX, 9600 baud, 9-bit mode)
- `bleprph_host_task` – NimBLE BLE peripheral (in `nimble.c`) for legacy device config and vend approvals
- MQTT client over WiFi for credit delivery and sales publishing
- Telemetry reader on UART1 (GPIO9 TX, GPIO8 RX) for DEX/DDCMP data — see
  "DEX wiring" below; GPIO43/44 named here previously are the ESP32-S3's
  default UART0 console pins, not this

**MDB State machine**: `INACTIVE → DISABLED → ENABLED → IDLE → VEND → IDLE`

**EXPANSION REQUEST ID** (`0x07`/`0x00`) is answered with the Level 1 30-byte
Peripheral ID, built once at task start by `mdb_build_peripheral_id()`. Some
VMCs reject it however it is formatted and only proceed once the reader goes
quiet; others (SandenVendo SN02-B) stay in DISABLED forever until it is
answered. The firmware answers up to `MDB_ID_MAX_ATTEMPTS` times per reset
cycle and then stays silent, which satisfies both.

**MDB bus diagnostics (`mdb_debug.c` / `mdb_debug.h`)**: passive
instrumentation of the bit-banged link, fed from the four bus primitives in
`mdb-slave-esp32s3.c` (`mdb_wait_start`, `mdb_sample_word`, `read_9`/
`read_9_timeout`, `write_payload_9`) so every byte in both directions is
accounted for. Keeps bus counters (framing/checksum/gap errors, ACK/NAK/RET,
short blocks, response latency, silences), a per-address command map, and a
rolling byte trace (`CONFIG_MDB_DEBUG_TRACE_DEPTH`, 256 entries ≈ 2 KiB),
plus automatic trace snapshots frozen around bus errors. Derives a one-word
verdict — `ok` / `reset_loop` / `polled_not_enabled` / `wrong_addr` /
`not_enabled` / `bus_silent` / `no_rx` — which answers the "is the VMC even
talking to us, and at which address" question directly.
`polled_not_enabled` is the case a healthy-looking link hides: the VMC polls
us and we answer, but it never sent READER ENABLE, so no session can open and
*neither* cashless vends *nor* the VMC's CASH SALE reports ever arrive. Because RX is wired to the MDB *master transmit* line only, every
received byte is known to come from the VMC, which makes the address map
exact rather than heuristic.

`vendCmd` tallies the VEND subcommands the VMC sends us. `cash` is the one
that matters when cash sales are missing: CASH SALE is optional in MDB and
many VMCs never send it, so `req > 0` with `cash` at 0 says outright that
this machine does not report cash over the bus and the DEX audit is the only
route. A VEND REQUEST also freezes a trace snapshot — overriding the error
snapshot's rate limit, because the 256-entry ring holds only seconds of idle
polling and the price bytes are what anyone asks about after a disputed sale.

`lastVend` records the most recent sale as it crossed the wire — the raw
16-bit price the VMC sent, the cents we published for it, and the running
min/max of the raw price — beside `scale`, the scale factor and decimal
places we advertised in SETUP CONFIG_DATA. Together they separate the three
ways a price can be wrong: the VMC really sends that number, we mangle it in
conversion, or the advertised units are too coarse to express the shelf price
(at scale factor 100 one unit *is* 1.00, so every price rounds to a whole
euro). `dex` reports the hourly audit's health — the only sales path that
does not depend on the reader being enabled, and previously invisible except
on the serial console.

Surfaces: a nested `bus` object on the existing `mdb-log` MQTT heartbeat
(merged additively into `embeddeds.mdb_diagnostics` by `mqtt-webhook` — no
migration), the captive portal's **MDB bus** panel plus
`GET /api/v1/mdb/diag`, `GET /api/v1/mdb/trace` and
`POST /api/v1/mdb/debug`, and the serial console. Runtime control via config
commands `0x33` (dump now), `0x34` (debug level, persisted), `0x35` (reset
counters) and `0x36` (start SoftAP for on-site access). Full field guide:
`docs/mdb-bus-debugging.md`. Host-testable without a board:
`mdb-slave-esp32s3/test/run.sh`.

Diagnostics never run inside the bit-sampling critical section, and the
state-change publish is deferred to an esp_timer one-shot that fires only
after the bus task has put its answer on the wire — an MQTT publish between
a VMC command and the response can exceed the 5 ms MDB response deadline.

**The sale publish is deferred the same way** (`mdb_pending_sale` /
`mdb_flush_pending_sale`). `sale_queue_enqueue()` publishes over MQTT on its
fast path and writes NVS on its slow one, and it used to be called straight
from the VEND_SUCCESS and CASH_SALE handlers — between the VMC's command and
our answer. A field device measured a worst-case response of 13.2 ms against
MDB's 5 ms budget and took a NAK for it. The handler now fills a slot that is
drained immediately after `write_payload_9()`. This trades away
`sale_queue.h`'s "persisted before the VMC is answered" guarantee for the
width of one MDB frame; missing the deadline risks the VMC resetting the
reader mid-session, which loses the sale far more surely.

**The DEX audit's first poll is armed from the MQTT connect handler**, two
minutes in, because a periodic timer's first fire is one full period away —
so before this a device rebooted with the machine had no audit data at all
for an hour, which is exactly the window in which someone is standing in
front of it asking where the cash sales went.

**DEX wiring**: the audit UART is GPIO9 (TX, to the machine) / GPIO8 (RX,
from the machine), and the two boards expose it very differently.

- `kicad/mdb-slave-esp32s3` (WiFi) has **no DEX connector and no DEX
  interface circuit** — the schematic has no `dex_*` net at all. GPIO8/9
  reach only the 2×11 expansion header `J4`, at pins 4 and 6 (silkscreened
  `08` and `09`), as bare 3.3 V logic straight off the SoC.
- `kicad/mdb-slave-esp32s3-sim7080g` (cellular) has both: connector `J3`
  (3-pin: GND / `dex_rx` / `dex_tx`) driven through a discrete open-collector
  buffer — Q5 and Q6 (MMBT3904) with R20–R23 pull-ups to +3V3. Signal
  reference is board ground; there is no galvanic isolation.

So a WiFi board cannot reach a machine's audit port without adding that
interface. `dex.polls` climbing with `lastOkMs` at -1 on such a board is
expected, not a fault.

**Price conversion (`mdb_price.h`)**: MDB carries prices as a 16-bit count of
scale-factor units, and the *reader* dictates the unit via the scale factor
and decimal places it puts in its SETUP CONFIG_DATA answer. `mdb_price.h`
converts between those units and the whole cents the sale payload carries,
with exact integer arithmetic. The previous `TO_SCALE_FACTOR`/
`FROM_SCALE_FACTOR` macros chained `pow(10, -dp)` and truncated into an
integer; `pow(10, -2)` is the double just *above* 1/100, so dividing by it
landed below the whole number and dropped a cent. At the shipping
configuration (scale factor 1, two decimals — a conversion that is
mathematically the identity) 16 of the first 401 prices came out a cent
short, 0.29, 1.16–1.19 and 2.05 among them, with nothing in any log to show
it. Conversions at two decimal places or fewer are now exact in both
directions; three decimal places is inherently lossy because the sale payload
carries whole cents. Host tests cover every scale factor / decimal place pair
menuconfig can produce: `mdb-slave-esp32s3/test/run.sh`.

**Nothing in `vTaskMdbEvent` may write to the console.** The console is
USB-Serial-JTAG, so `ESP_LOG` blocks until the USB host drains the endpoint
(milliseconds with a terminal attached, at DEBUG log level), which both
delays the response past the 5 ms deadline and loses the next command —
producing a VMC that resets the reader forever and never polls it. The bus
task formats into a ring (`mdb_log_defer`) that `mdb_log_task` drains,
dropping lines rather than stalling the bus.

**Security**: MQTT and BLE payloads use XOR obfuscation with an 18-byte `passkey` plus a ±8 second timestamp window to prevent replay attacks.

**MQTT topics**: `/{company_id}/{device_id}/{event}` where events are: `sale`, `status`, `paxcounter`, `dex`, `mdb-log`, `credit`, `ota`, `config`

**NVS namespace `vmflow`** keys:
- `company_id` – UUID from companies table
- `device_id` – UUID from embeddeds table
- `passkey` – 18-char XOR cipher key
- `prov_code` – one-time provisioning code (erased after successful claim)
- `srv_url` – backend server URL (also used for OTA)
- `mqtt_host` – MQTT broker hostname
- `mqtt_port` – MQTT broker port
- `mqtt_user` – MQTT username
- `mqtt_pass` – MQTT password
- `mdb_addr` – MDB peripheral address selector (1=0x10, 2=0x60), set via config cmd 0x31
- `mdb_dbg` – MDB bus debug level 0-3 (see "MDB bus diagnostics"), set via config cmd 0x34 or the captive portal
- `restart_reason` – set by `tracked_restart()` before reboot, erased on next boot after publish
- `last_uptime` – uptime at the moment of `tracked_restart()`, paired with `restart_reason`
- `apn` – cellular APN (P1+, set via captive portal `/api/v1/cellular/configure`)
- `sim_pin` – optional cellular SIM PIN (P1+; empty for PIN-less SIMs)
- `lte_mode` – cellular LTE mode selector u8 (1=Cat-M, 2=NB-IoT, 3=Both)

**Reset paths and what they erase:**
- **Factory reset** (boot button held 5 s, `factory_reset_task` in main.c) → `nvs_flash_erase()` wipes the **entire NVS partition** including all keys above. The only way to fully clear cellular config without overwriting it.
- **NVS corruption recovery** (NVS init fails with `NO_FREE_PAGES`/`NEW_VERSION_FOUND`) → also a full `nvs_flash_erase`.
- **Successful claim** (`provision_claim_task`) → erases only `prov_code`. Cellular config persists across the post-claim reboot, which is the intended behaviour (post-claim devices keep their APN).
- **Soft restarts** (OTA, MQTT watchdog, config cmd 0x30, provision-failure retry loop) → reboot only, no NVS keys touched. Cellular config persists, which is intended (so the device re-attaches to the same APN automatically).
- **`/api/v1/cellular/configure`** rejects empty APN — once set, an APN can only be **overwritten** (with a new value), not gap-deleted via the captive portal. Factory reset is the only way to fully clear it.

**WiFi / provisioning boot flow**:
1. On `WIFI_EVENT_STA_START`, calls `esp_wifi_connect()`. If it returns an error (no saved credentials), immediately starts SoftAP + captive portal DNS + HTTP server.
2. On repeated `WIFI_EVENT_STA_DISCONNECTED` (retry limit hit), also starts SoftAP.
3. Captive portal serves `webui/index.html` (embedded via CMakeLists `EMBED_FILES`). User enters WiFi credentials + provisioning code + server URL.
4. `webui_server.c` saves `prov_code` and `srv_url` to NVS, then calls `esp_wifi_connect()`.
5. On `IP_EVENT_STA_GOT_IP`, if `prov_code` is in NVS, spawns `provision_claim_task` instead of starting MQTT.
6. `provision_claim_task` POSTs `{short_code, mac_address}` to `{srv_url}/functions/v1/claim-device`, saves returned `company_id`, `device_id`, `passkey`, `mqtt_host`, `mqtt_port` to NVS, erases `prov_code`, calls `esp_restart()`.
7. After reboot, device finds `company_id` + `device_id` + `passkey` in NVS and starts MQTT normally.

**CMakeLists.txt**: Uses explicit `REQUIRES` — adding a new header include likely requires adding the owning component to `REQUIRES` in `main/CMakeLists.txt` (e.g. `esp_wifi`, `esp_http_client`, `mqtt`, `driver`, `bt`, etc.).

**Network manager (`network.c` / `network.h`)**: Single orchestrator for
the device's uplink. At boot, `network_init()` calls `modem_probe()` and
branches:
- **Modem detected** → cellular-only boot. WiFi STA is NOT initialised.
  SoftAP comes up immediately. If an APN is in NVS (post-claim or
  pre-configured), `cellular_bring_up_task` runs `modem_init` +
  `modem_connect`. P3 captive portal calls `network_cellular_configure`
  with new credentials.
- **No modem** → WiFi-only boot. Behaviour identical to the pre-P2
  firmware: `esp_wifi_init` + STA/AP netifs + `esp_wifi_start`. SoftAP
  comes up after `WIFI_SOFTAP_AFTER` failed connect attempts.

`mdb-slave-esp32s3.c` registers a single callback via
`network_register_callback` that fires on `NETWORK_EVENT_UPLINK_UP` —
the callback either spawns `provision_claim_task` (first-boot claim
flow) or starts the MQTT client. The pre-P2 inline `wifi_event_handler`
(~165 lines) was extracted into `network.c`.

**Captive portal wizard (P3)**: `webui_server.c` exposes
`GET /api/v1/system/info` (returns `{variant, wizard_state, uplink:{kind,wifi,cellular}, claim:{claimed, prov_code_set}}` from `network_get_status()`),
plus three POST endpoints: `/api/v1/cellular/configure` `{apn, pin, lte_mode}`,
`/api/v1/wifi/configure` `{ssid, password}` (rejected on cellular boards),
and `/api/v1/claim` `{prov_code, srv_url}` (writes NVS + spawns
`provision_claim_task` from `provision.h`), plus the MDB debug trio
`GET /api/v1/mdb/diag`, `GET /api/v1/mdb/trace` and
`POST /api/v1/mdb/debug` `{level, reset}`.
The captive portal HTML (`webui/index.html`, embedded via `EMBED_FILES`)
is a vanilla-JS SPA: polls `/system/info` every 2 s, renders one of 7
wizard-state views (booting, offline, cellular_config, cellular_registering,
wifi_connecting, ready_to_claim, claimed), shows a status banner with
signal bars + operator + IP, and disables submit buttons during in-flight
or registering states. Below the wizard sits a collapsible **MDB bus**
panel (hidden unless `/api/v1/mdb/diag` answers, so it degrades cleanly on
older firmware) rendering the bus verdict in plain language, the counters,
the named address map, the debug-level selector and a trace viewer. The old combined `/api/v1/settings/set` endpoint
was removed in P3.

**Cellular recovery (P4 + post-milestone hardening)**: Multi-layer escalation. Layer 1 — `network.c::ppp_reconnect_task` retries `modem_disconnect`+`modem_connect` 3 times on `IP_EVENT_PPP_LOST_IP`, ~6 s total. Layer 1.5/1.6/2/3 — `cellular_bring_up_task` recovery ladder triggers on **either** IPCP timeout **or phantom-PPP** (TCP probe to 1.1.1.1:53 fails after PPP_GOT_IP). Steps: `modem_pdp_reset` (CGACT=0/1, ~5s) → `modem_rf_reset` (CFUN=0/1, ~10s) → `modem_soft_restart` (CFUN=1,1, ~12s) → `modem_hard_reset` (PMU DC3 cut + PWRKEY, ~15s, true reset). Each step is followed by `modem_connect` + reachability probe; only if probe succeeds is `UPLINK_UP` fired. Worst-case ~3-4 min ladder traversal before bailing OFFLINE; `offline_retry` timer (30s) re-spawns fresh `cellular_bring_up_task`. Layer 4 — `modem.c::modem_watchdog_task` (30 s tick) calls `modem_hard_reset` after 3 consecutive `AT` failures (bounded to 2 hard-resets before deferring to Layer 5). Layer 5 — `mqtt_watchdog_cb` hard-reboots after 10 min without MQTT. MQTT keepalive bumps to 180 s + network/reconnect timeouts to 30 s/20 s when uplink is cellular at `esp_mqtt_client_init` time. Known limitation: at MQTT-init time `network_init()` has not yet run, so `modem_present` is false and cellular boards still get the WiFi-tuned MQTT values on the first connection. The watchdog task is started exclusively from `cellular_bring_up_task` (after `modem_connect` succeeds), so WiFi-only boards never spawn it.

**Phantom-PPP detection (post-milestone)**: SIM7080G has two parallel network stacks (host PPP + internal AT+CIP*/AT+CNACT*) sharing the same PDP context. Residue in the internal stack splits the PDP binding — IPCP completes and inbound flows (cached air-side state) but outbound silently drops at GTP. Field symptom: TLS cert downloads OK, ClientKeyExchange never reaches server, server FINs at 15s timeout. **Three-layer protection**: (1) `modem_init` proactively clears state via `AT+CIPSHUT` + `AT+CNACT=0,0` (best-effort, ignore errors); (2) `modem_connect` verifies PDP via `AT+CGCONTRDP=1` poll (5×1s) after `+CEREG: 1,5` — confirms data attach actually completed before entering DATA mode; (3) `network.c::probe_internet_tcp("1.1.1.1", 53, 5000ms)` runs after `PPP_GOT_IP_BIT` and BEFORE `UPLINK_UP` — failed probe triggers recovery ladder immediately instead of letting MQTT/claim waste minutes on a dead path. **Important**: never call `AT+CGACT=1,1` manually on LTE — the default bearer auto-activates with registration; manual call introduces the race that creates phantom-PPP in the first place. **Note**: `10.0.0.1` in `PPP GOT_IP` log is the SIMCom IPCP peer placeholder (normal), not a stub from a half-broken state.

**Cellular telemetry surface (P5)**: Status MQTT payload is extended additively when uplink is cellular: `online|v:VER|b:BUILD|uplink:cellular|op:NAME|rssi:DBM|mode:RAT|ip:ADDR`. The `mqtt-webhook` Edge Function parses any `key:value` segments after `parts[2]` and merges them into `embeddeds.mdb_diagnostics.cellular` jsonb (no DB migration). The frontend `CellularHealthBadge.vue` component renders signal bars + operator + mode pill on `/devices` and `/machines/[id]` when `diagnostics.cellular.uplink === 'cellular'`. Old firmware (3-segment status) is unchanged on both sides; the badge renders nothing for non-cellular devices.

**Cellular driver (`modem.c` / `modem.h`)**: SIM7080G driver introduced
in P1. Public API: `modem_probe`, `modem_init`, `modem_connect`,
`modem_disconnect`, `modem_status`, `modem_power_cycle` (single PWRKEY
pulse — cold-boot only), `modem_hard_reset` (true cycle: PMU DC3 cut +
PWRKEY, used by recovery ladder), `modem_pdp_reset` / `modem_rf_reset`
/ `modem_soft_restart` (intermediate recovery layers), plus NVS helpers
`modem_nvs_load`/`modem_nvs_save` (promoted to the public API in P2).
All callers now go through `network.c` — no part of `app_main` touches
`esp_modem_*` directly.

### mdb-master-esp32s3 Architecture

VMC simulator, polls MDB peripherals at addresses 0x08, 0x10, 0x60. Button ISR (`button0_isr_handler`) triggers a vend cycle. LED strip on GPIO48. DEX reader on GPIO17/18.

## Docker Backend

All services configured via `Docker/.env` (copy from `.env.example`). Run commands from the `Docker/` directory.

```bash
# Start all services (Supabase + API gateway + MQTT broker + forwarder)
docker compose up

# Tear down everything
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

### Key Services

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `kong` (port 8000) | API gateway |
| `db` | PostgreSQL 15.8 |
| `auth` | Supabase GoTrue |
| `rest` | PostgREST API |
| `realtime` | Supabase Realtime |
| `storage` | Supabase Storage |
| `imgproxy` | Image transformation proxy |
| `meta` | Postgres Meta |
| `functions` | Deno edge runtime |
| `studio` (port 54323) | Supabase Studio dashboard |
| `broker` (port 1883) | Eclipse Mosquitto MQTT |
| `forwarder` | Deno MQTT→Supabase webhook bridge |
| `frontend` (port 3000) | Nuxt 4 management app |

### MQTT Forwarder

`Docker/mqtt/forwarder/main.ts` is a Deno service that subscribes to MQTT topics `/+/+/sale`, `/+/+/status`, `/+/+/paxcounter`, `/+/+/mdb-log` and forwards raw payloads (base64-encoded) to the `mqtt-webhook` Supabase edge function via HTTP POST with webhook secret authentication. The `mqtt-webhook` function decrypts XOR payloads, validates checksum + timestamp (±8s), and writes to Supabase tables. The `mdb-log` topic carries plaintext JSON diagnostics (no XOR encryption).

### Supabase Local Development

```bash
cd Docker/supabase
supabase start    # starts local Supabase on ports 54321 (API), 54322 (DB), 54323 (Studio)
supabase db reset # re-runs all migrations + seed
```

`config.toml` sets a unique `project_id = "mdb-esp32-cashless"` so the CLI's local Docker containers/volumes (`supabase_db_mdb-esp32-cashless`, …) don't collide with other local Supabase projects on the same host. Two projects sharing a `project_id` would share one local database — bleeding each other's migration history and breaking `supabase migration up`. Run the CLI from `Docker/supabase` and start only one stack at a time (ports are shared on the defaults).

### Database Migrations (IMMUTABLE)

**Migrations in `Docker/supabase/migrations/*.sql` are immutable once committed to `main`.** Never edit an existing migration file after it has been pushed — always create a new migration with a later timestamp instead.

**Why this matters**: `Docker/update.sh` tracks applied migrations by filename (in `public._migrations`), not by content hash. Editing an already-applied migration leaves every existing database running the OLD version while git source carries the NEW one — a silent divergence that stays latent until the buggy code path is finally executed. This happened once (2026-04-11) with `20260406000000_tax_infrastructure.sql`: the `stamp_machine_and_decrement_stock` trigger was first committed with `ROUND(NEW.item_price / ...)` where `item_price` is `float8` (producing the runtime error `function round(double precision, integer) does not exist`), and later the same file was edited in commit `69effe6` to add `::numeric` casts. Every DB that had already applied the first version kept the buggy trigger; the bug only surfaced days later when the first sale satisfied the `v_tax_rate IS NOT NULL` guard, killing the MQTT sales pipeline for ~24h.

**How to fix a bug in an existing migration:**

1. Leave the old migration file untouched
2. Create a new migration `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_fix_<short_description>.sql` with a higher timestamp
3. Use idempotent operations: `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`, `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, `DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS` / `CREATE TRIGGER`, etc.
4. The new migration will automatically be applied by `update.sh` on every existing installation and is a no-op on fresh installs that already got the fixed version via ordered apply

**Enforcement:** `.githooks/pre-commit` rejects staged changes to migration files that already exist on `origin/main`. Install once per clone with `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh` (sets `core.hooksPath`). To intentionally bypass — only when you are certain the migration has never been applied anywhere (e.g. you created it in the same uncommitted session) — commit with `--no-verify`.

### Database Schema

Multi-tenancy model: users belong to `companies` via `organization_members`. All RLS policies use the helper functions `my_company_id()` and `i_am_admin()` which read from `organization_members` for the current JWT user.

Tables:
- `companies` – organisations; has `anthropic_api_key` (nullable) for AI insights, `velocity_days` (default 30) for sales velocity calculation
- `organization_members` – `(company_id, user_id, role)` where role ∈ `{admin, viewer}`
- `invitations` – email-scoped invite tokens with expiry
- `embeddeds` – registered devices: `subdomain` (bigint, auto-increment), `mac_address`, `passkey`, `status`, `mdb_diagnostics` (jsonb), `vmc_level` (int)
- `sales` – vend events: `embedded_id`, `item_price` (**EUR, not cents**), `item_number`, `channel`, `lat`, `lng`, `machine_id`; has `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` for realtime delete events
- `paxcounter` – foot traffic: `embedded_id`, `count`
- `device_provisioning` – one-time provisioning codes: `short_code`, `expires_at`, `used_at`, `embedded_id`
- `vendingMachine` – physical machine records linked to embedded devices; `nayax_machine_id` (nullable text, UNIQUE per company) maps to a Nayax serial for `/reports/nayax-reconciliation`; `contact_phone`/`whatsapp_phone`/`support_hours`/`contact_email` are nullable **overrides** of the company imprint used by printed posters (empty = inherit)
- `products`, `product_category` – product catalogue per company; `products.image_path` stores the storage object path; `products.discontinued` (boolean) flag
- `machine_trays` – per-machine tray/slot configuration: `machine_id`, `item_number` (unique per machine), `product_id`, `capacity`, `current_stock`, `fill_when_below` (refill threshold), `product_assigned_at` (timestamp the current product was assigned to the slot, restamped on product change via trigger); stock auto-decremented on sales via `stamp_machine_and_decrement_stock` trigger
- `machine_product_offerings` – per-`(machine_id, product_id)` offering history for the Analysis tab: `offered_since` timestamp tracks how long a product has been offered in a machine **independent of which slot(s) it occupies**. Maintained by an AFTER trigger on `machine_trays` (`maintain_machine_product_offerings`): moving a product between slots keeps the offering open; only removing it from every slot closes it (a later re-add starts a fresh trial). Used so the "testing" grace period survives slot moves.
- `poster_layouts` – saved poster configuration per motif: which QR source sits in which slot, the operator's own link, overridden headlines/labels, and the content blocks. `machine_id IS NULL` is the company default, a set `machine_id` overrides it for one machine (partial unique indexes enforce one row each). Read by every member, written by admins.
- `api_keys` – API keys for external integrations: `company_id`, `key_hash`, `key_prefix`, `name`
- `warehouses` – warehouse locations per company
- `product_barcodes` – barcode-to-product mapping for scanning
- `warehouse_stock_batches` – FIFO stock batches with expiry tracking
- `warehouse_transactions` – stock movement log (intake, refill, adjustment, waste)
- `product_min_stock` – per-warehouse minimum stock levels for alerts
- `warehouse_product_positions` – physical layout ordering: `warehouse_id`, `product_id`, `sort_order`, `location_label`
- `low_stock_notifications` – queue table for push alerts when stock drops below minimum; auto-enqueued via trigger
- `stock_decrement_log` – audit log for stock decrements
- `mdb_log` – MDB state-change diagnostics history per device
- `push_subscriptions` – browser push notification registrations (endpoint, keys, user_agent)
- `history` – activity log for audit trail

Key RPC functions:
- `get_machine_insights_kpis(machine_id, company_id, days)` – per-tray (slot-based) KPIs, paxcounter conversion, refill history for AI insights
- `get_machine_product_kpis(machine_id, company_id, days)` – **product-centric** per-machine KPIs for the Analysis tab: aggregates sales by `sales.product_id` (snapshotted at sale time) across all of a product's slots, server-side (no PostgREST row-limit truncation), plus `total_capacity`/`total_stock`/`slots`/`offered_since`
- `get_product_sales_velocity(company_id, days)` – avg daily units sold per product
- `delete_sale_and_restore_stock(sale_id)` – manual sale deletion with stock restoration
- `insert_manual_sale(machine_id, item_number, price, channel, created_at)` – manual sale insertion
- `deduct_warehouse_stock_fifo(...)` – FIFO warehouse stock deduction for refills

### Supabase Storage

Buckets defined in `config.toml`:
- `product-images` – public, max 2MiB, PNG/JPEG/WebP; images stored as `{product_id}.{ext}`
- `company-logos` – public, max 2MiB, PNG/JPEG/WebP (no SVG: XSS vector in a public bucket); logo stored as `{company_id}.{ext}`, path in `companies.logo_path`
- `firmware` – public, max 5MiB, binary files for OTA updates

To apply only pending migrations without resetting data: `supabase migration up`

### Edge Functions (`Docker/supabase/functions/`)

All functions use `verify_jwt = false` in `config.toml` (workaround for ES256 `CryptoKey` bug in local edge runtime). Identity is verified inside each function via `adminClient.auth.getUser(token)` where `token` is extracted from the `Authorization` header.

|----------|--------------|---------|
| `create-organization` | yes | Create company + make caller admin |
| `invite-member` | admin | Upsert invitation token |
| `accept-invitation` | yes | Join org via invite token |
| `get-my-organization` | yes | Returns `{organization, role}` or `{organization: null}` |
| `create-provisioning-token` | admin | Generate 8-char one-time device code (chars: `ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTUVWXYZ23456789`) |
| `claim-device` | none | Called by firmware; validates code, creates `embeddeds` row, returns `{company_id, device_id, passkey, mqtt_host, mqtt_port}` |
| `send-credit` | yes | Encrypt + publish credit to device MQTT topic |
| `request-credit` | yes | Related credit request flow |
| `mqtt-webhook` | webhook secret | Receives forwarded MQTT payloads, decrypts + validates + writes to DB |
| `trigger-ota` | admin | Publishes OTA firmware URL to device MQTT topic |
| `import-products` | admin | Bulk import products from Nayax Excel export |
| `register-push` | yes | Register browser push notification subscription |
| `test-push` | yes | Send test push notification |
| `send-device-config` | admin | Send device configuration update via MQTT |
| `create-api-key` | admin | Generate API key for external integrations |
| `check-low-stock` | internal | Reads unsent low-stock notifications, groups by company, sends push alerts, marks as sent |
| `import-github-release` | admin | Import firmware binary from GitHub release tag into storage + firmware_versions |
| `machine-insights` | yes | AI-powered analytics (Claude API): per-machine/company KPIs, recommendations, multi-language, 6h cache |
| `search-product-images` | yes | DuckDuckGo image search for product catalog enrichment |

### Extension Points (Provider Pattern)

Some features have a per-company provider registry rather than a single hardcoded backend. v1 covers `deal-source` (the `/deals` page's data sources). Each extension point's contract lives at `Docker/supabase/functions/_shared/providers/<extension-point>.ts` with built-in providers as TypeScript modules under `_shared/providers/<extension-point>/<provider-id>.ts` and per-company activation in the `provider_settings` table. Documentation per extension point lives at `docs/extension-points/<extension-point>.md` — that file is the SDK; read it before adding a new provider.

### Adding New Environment Variables

When adding a new env var that the frontend or edge functions need in production, update **all** of these:

| File | What to add |
|------|-------------|
| `Docker/.env.example` | Default/placeholder value |
| `Docker/setup.sh` | Generation logic + write to `.env` output |
| `Docker/update.sh` | Auto-generation for existing installs (if applicable) |
| `management-frontend/Dockerfile` | `ARG` + `ENV` (if needed at Nuxt build time) |
| `Docker/docker-compose.yml` | `build.args` for frontend (if needed at Nuxt build time) |
| `Docker/supabase/config.toml` | `[edge_runtime.secrets]` (if needed by edge functions) |

**Frontend build-time vars**: Nuxt `runtimeConfig` reads `process.env` at build time. Any var referenced in `nuxt.config.ts` must be available during `npm run build` inside Docker — this means it must be passed as a Docker build arg (`ARG` + `ENV` in Dockerfile, `build.args` in docker-compose.yml).

**Edge function config**: Each edge function needs a `[functions.<name>]` section in `config.toml` with `import_map` pointing to its `deno.json` file. The self-hosted edge runtime reads secrets from `[edge_runtime.secrets]`.

**Shared modules** (`Docker/supabase/functions/_shared/`):
- `mqtt-publish.ts` – reusable MQTT publish helper (connects to broker, publishes, disconnects)
- `web-push.ts` – web push notification sender

---

## management-frontend

Nuxt 4 (`app/` directory convention), TypeScript, `@nuxtjs/supabase`, shadcn-nuxt, TailwindCSS 4, `@vueuse/core`, `@nuxtjs/i18n` (en/de), PWA (custom service worker).

```bash
cd management-frontend
npm install
npm run dev      # dev server on http://localhost:3000
```

**Environment** (`.env` in `management-frontend/`):
```
SUPABASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:54321   # port 54321 = API, NOT 54323 (Studio)
SUPABASE_KEY=<anon key>
```

### Auth & Organisation Flow

The `app/middleware/auth.ts` middleware runs on every protected route:
1. Checks `useSupabaseUser()` → redirect to `/auth/login` if unauthenticated
2. **Skips org fetch on SSR** (`import.meta.server`) — the `plugins/supabase-url.client.ts` plugin rewrites the Supabase URL to the browser hostname on the client only; SSR calls would use the raw `127.0.0.1` URL and fail auth
3. On client: calls `fetchOrganization()` from `useOrganization()` composable (cached in `useState('organization')` + `useState('org-role')`)
4. If no organisation → redirect to `/onboarding/create-organization`

Public routes (no auth check): `/auth/login`, `/auth/register`, `/onboarding/*`

### Key Composables

**Core data:**
- `useOrganization()` – wraps `get-my-organization`, exposes `organization`, `role`, `fetchOrganization()`
- `useMachines()` – fetches `vendingMachine` joined with `embeddeds`, batch-fetches per-machine stats (today/yesterday revenue, sales count, paxcounter, last sale) via `Promise.all`; `subscribeToStatusUpdates()` opens Supabase realtime channels on `embeddeds`, `vendingMachine`, and `sales` tables (live-updates today's stats on new sales)
- `useProducts()` – CRUD for products + categories; `uploadProductImage(productId, file)` uploads to `product-images/{id}.{ext}` with upsert; `deleteProductImage()` removes from storage + nulls `image_path`; `deleteProduct()` cleans up storage; `getProductImageUrl(path)` builds public URL; `createProduct()` returns the new product ID
- `usePosterFreshness()` – per machine: does the sign hanging on it still show the current contact data? Recomputes the contact fingerprint from today's data using the blocks the `poster_printed` entry recorded, and compares it with the fingerprint stored at print time — so a motif change or a reprint in another language is not a change, but a new support number is. Drives the "sign out of date" badge on `/machines` and the banner on `/machines/[id]`
- `useMachinePrint()` – data, QR rendering and layout persistence for the printable machine posters (`/machines/[id]/print`): resolves `machine.x ?? company.x` contact data, resolves each motif **slot** to a QR target (machine page / `tel:` / WhatsApp / fault form / the operator's own link / empty), renders them as **SVG** (not data URLs — visibly sharper at 5 cm on paper), loads and saves `poster_layouts`, and writes the `poster_printed` activity entry. The pure logic lives in `app/lib/printSheet.ts` and is unit-tested; motifs declare their slots, editable headlines and blocks in `app/lib/printMotifs.ts`
- `useMachineTrays()` – CRUD for machine tray/slot configuration; `batchCreateTrays(machineId, startSlot, count, capacity)` bulk-inserts sequential slots; `updateTray()` updates by ID (allows slot number changes); `subscribeToTrayUpdates()` for realtime stock changes; stock auto-decrements on sales via DB trigger
- `useMachineAnalysis()` – powers the Analysis tab on `/machines/[id]`. **Product-centric** performance analysis: combines `get_machine_product_kpis` (sales aggregated per product across all its slots), `get_product_sales_velocity` (fleet-wide velocity), the product catalogue, and `machine_product_offerings` tenure. Exposes pure, unit-tested helpers — `slotRowCol`/`computeSlotWidths`/`buildGridSlots` (replicate the iOS layout: 10 columns, `row=max(0,⌊item/10⌋-1)`, `col=item%10`, width=gap to next slot), `scoreProduct` (tier: dead/weak/ok/strong, plus a "testing" grace period for products offered < ~14 days so freshly-placed or brand-new test products aren't condemned), and `buildSuggestionPool` (replacement candidates = proven fleet bestsellers + never-sold "newcomer" test products). `applySwap(trayId, productId)` reassigns a slot's product (resets stock to 0, logs `product_swapped` to `activity_log`)
- `useFirmware()` – CRUD for firmware versions in `firmware` storage bucket; `triggerOta(deviceId, firmwareId)` calls `trigger-ota` edge function
- `useImportProducts()` – parses Nayax Excel exports, previews products, bulk imports via `import-products` edge function
- `useNotifications()` – browser push notification registration and management via `register-push` edge function
- `useWarehouse()` – CRUD for warehouses, stock batches (FIFO), transactions, barcode lookups, min-stock alerts; `deductStock()` calls `deduct_warehouse_stock_fifo` DB function for refill operations
- `useMdbLog()` – fetches MDB diagnostics history from `mdb_log` table with realtime subscription
- `useActivityLog()` – activity/audit log composable

**Refill & insights:**
- `useRefillWizard()` – multi-step refill tour state: packing → refill → summary; combined/per-machine picking modes, warehouse stock tracking, persistent state for resume
- `useTourHistory()` – fetches activity log entries grouped by `tour_id` (with 10-min fallback grouping), enriches user display names
- `useStockHistory()` – merges stock events from sales, activity log, and `stock_decrement_log` into unified tray timeline
- `useInsights()` – manages AI-powered machine/company insights, history, loading states via `machine-insights` edge function
- `useProductImageSearch()` – wraps `search-product-images` edge function with debounce and caching
- `useNayaxReconciliation()` – Nayax sales export reconciliation: xlsx parsing, timezone helpers (`localDtToUtc`, `parseSelectionInfo`, `parseTitleDateRange`, `derivedChannelFromPaymentSource`), `useState`-shared workflow state, paginated `loadDbSales` (1000-row chunks to defeat PostgREST `max_rows`), greedy one-to-one matcher with ±tolerance, bulk-import via `insert_manual_sale` + per-row ghost delete via `delete_sale_and_restore_stock` (both with `activity_log` entries tagged `source: nayax_reconciliation`), `exportDiffCsv`. Used by `/reports/nayax-reconciliation` page and the `app/components/nayax/*` step components.

**UI utilities:**
- `useTheme()` – wraps `useDark` from `@vueuse/core`; theme persisted to `localStorage` as `color-scheme`
- `useAppResume()` – app lifecycle/resume event handling
- `useAppUpdate()` – detects new service worker versions, provides `applyUpdate()` to reload
- `useInstallPrompt()` – PWA install prompt handling with iOS detection and dismissal tracking
- `usePullToRefresh()` – registers page-level pull-to-refresh handler via shared `useState`
- `useModalForm()` – generic reusable modal form state (open/close, form data, loading, error, submit)
- `useTableSort()` – generic table sorting with key + direction toggle

### Plugins

- `supabase-url.client.ts` – rewrites Supabase URL to browser hostname (client-only, required for LAN access)
- `register-sw.client.ts` – custom service worker registration (PWA uses custom SW in `public/sw.js`, not Workbox)

### Shared Utilities (`app/lib/utils.ts`)

- `cn()` – Tailwind class merging via clsx + tailwind-merge
- `timeAgo(dt)` – i18n-aware relative time formatting (e.g. "5m ago", "2d ago")
- `formatCurrency(amount)` – formats a number as EUR currency
- `formatDate(dt)` – date formatting
- `formatTime(dt)` – time formatting
- `formatDateTime(dt)` – combined date+time formatting

### Pages

- `/` – Dashboard: KPI cards (today/week sales, machine counts) + 30-day sales chart + activity feed + machine list + recent sales
- `/machines` – Responsive card grid (1/2/3 cols) of vending machines showing status badge, today/yesterday revenue, sales count, last sale time-ago, and paxcounter traffic; cards link to `/machines/[id]`
- `/machines/[id]` – Per-machine detail with tabs: **Sales** (30-day chart + sales history with product image thumbnails from trays, manual sale add/delete); **Trays & Stock** (tray table, batch add (sequential slots), single add/edit (editable slot numbers), refill, delete); **Analysis** (product-centric performance — an iOS-springboard-style layout grid where each slot is colour-coded by its product's tier (dead/weak/testing/ok/strong); a "products to review" list with combined per-product KPIs + machine tenure; one-click replacement with fleet bestsellers or never-sold test products; on-demand AI `product_swap` recommendations); plus MDB diagnostics (admin) and Device Health tabs
- `/machines/[id]/print` – Printable contact signage for a machine: seven A4/A5/A6 poster motifs — also offered as three n-up sheets that tile 2 × A5, 4 × A6 or 8 × A7 onto one A4 page, tiles rotated where the arithmetic requires it and separated by dashed cut lines through the gutters — plus eight sticker motifs in three sizes (90×50 mm 8-up, 50×30 mm 24-up, 148×40 mm landscape strip 6-up, all with cut marks), picked from a gallery of live thumbnails rendered from the machine's own data. Every QR slot's source is operator-chosen (machine page / `tel:` / WhatsApp / fault form / own link / empty), headlines and per-slot labels are overridable with a reset-to-default, and the whole configuration saves to `poster_layouts` per company or per machine. Plus per-sheet language, one-off free text, and batch selection across machines. Prints via `window.print()` with `@page` + `print-color-adjust: exact`. Its own route rather than a modal so the app chrome never has to be hidden. The QR origin comes from `SITE_URL` (`runtimeConfig.public.siteUrl`); a LAN or localhost origin raises a blocking-looking warning, because a wrong QR on paper is permanent
- `/products` – Products tab (table with image thumbnails, add/edit modal with image upload zone + image search, category selector, discontinued flag) + Categories tab + Import from Nayax Excel
- `/warehouse` – Warehouse inventory management: stock intake with barcode scanning (`BarcodeScanner` component), FIFO batch tracking, transaction history, min-stock alerts, product position management
- `/refill` – Multi-step guided refill wizard: select warehouse → pack items (combined/per-machine mode) → refill trays → summary with tour stats
- `/tour-history` – Expandable list of completed refill tours with per-machine details, user names, timestamps
- `/reports/nayax-reconciliation` – Upload Nayax sales export (.xlsx), wizard with persistent Nayax↔VM mapping (in `vendingMachine.nayax_machine_id`), greedy time-tolerant matcher, three result buckets (matched / missing-in-DB / ghost-in-DB), bulk import of missing as manual sales via `insert_manual_sale`, per-row ghost delete via `delete_sale_and_restore_stock`, CSV diff export. Auditing tagged with `source: nayax_reconciliation` in `activity_log`.
- `/history` – Activity/audit log
- `/devices` – Admin device management: registered embedded devices table, register new device with provisioning code + QR, pending tokens, delete device
- `/firmware` – Firmware version management: upload .bin files + import from GitHub releases, deploy OTA to devices, delete versions
- `/api-keys` – API key management: create/revoke keys for external integrations
- `/members` – Active members table + pending invitations (admin only); invite modal calls `invite-member`
- `/settings` – Application settings (incl. Anthropic API key for AI insights, velocity days config)
- `/server-loading` – Full-screen loading page with auto-retry for server availability
- `/onboarding/create-organization` – Calls `create-organization` edge function
- `/onboarding/accept-invitation` – Reads `?token=` from URL, calls `accept-invitation`

```bash
cd management-frontend
npx vitest run          # run all tests
npx vitest run --watch  # watch mode
```
