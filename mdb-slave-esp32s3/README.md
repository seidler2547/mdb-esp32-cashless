# ESP32 - MDB Cashless Device Implementation
This project aims to implement an MDB (Multi-Drop Bus) cashless device using an ESP32 microcontroller. The goal is to enable the ESP32 to interface with vending machines and other devices that support the MDB protocol, allowing for cashless transactions using modern payment methods such as mobile payments, contactless cards, or online accounts.

## Diagnosing the MDB bus

The firmware watches every byte on the link and reduces it to a verdict
(`ok`, `wrong_addr`, `not_enabled`, `bus_silent`, `no_rx`), a set of bus
counters, a per-address command map and a rolling byte trace — readable over
MQTT, over the captive portal's **MDB bus** panel, and on the serial console.
See **[docs/mdb-bus-debugging.md](../docs/mdb-bus-debugging.md)** for the
field guide: what each counter means, how to read a trace, the remote
commands, and the signatures of the common failures.

The analysis code is unit-tested on the host, no board required:

```sh
test/run.sh
```

## ⚠️ Cellular (SIM7080G) board not plug-and-play

The modem driver in `main/modem.c` targets the LilyGo T-SIM7080G-S3 devkit
pinout (GPIO4/5 for the modem UART, GPIO41 for PWRKEY, I2C on GPIO15/7 for
an AXP2101 PMU), not the custom `kicad/mdb-slave-esp32s3-sim7080g` PCB.
That PCB's modem UART/PWRKEY are actually wired to GPIO17/18/14 (matching
this file's already-present but currently unused `PIN_SIM7080G_*`
defines), and — more importantly — **GPIO4/5 are wired to the MDB bus on
that PCB**, so `modem.c` as it stands today would claim pins that are
already in use. Flashing this firmware onto that board will not bring up
cellular connectivity as-is. See
`kicad/mdb-slave-esp32s3-sim7080g/README.md` for the full pin trace and
what reconciling the two would take.
